# Introduction
This is a notebook to document the combining of Harris County voter records with census block data

# Setup
Load required packages
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(magrittr)
```

# Exploration
Input and look at the available data to see what we have.
We have:

* Precinct shapefiles - boundaries on which vote shares are reported.
* Voting district shapefiles - some kind of method of matching precincts to census blocks.
```{r input}
precinct <- st_read(here::here("data", "Precincts", "Precincts.shp"))
vtds <- st_read(here::here("data", "VTDs", "VTDs.shp"))
```
